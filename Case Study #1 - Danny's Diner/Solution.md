### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

````sql
SELECT customer_id,
       COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS total_days_visited
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
````
#### Output :

| customer_id | total_days_visited |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| A           | 4                  |
| B           | 6                  |

       COUNT(s.product_id) AS count
FROM sales AS s
JOIN menu AS m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 1;
````

#### Output :
| most_purchased_item | count |

	     m.product_name,
             DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date DESC) AS rnk
      FROM menu AS m
      JOIN sales AS s ON m.product_id = s.product_id
      JOIN members AS mem ON s.customer_id = mem.customer_id
      WHERE s.order_date< mem.join_date) AS temp_table
